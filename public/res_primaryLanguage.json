      "description": "I’m Chloe Nott and I'm a former manufacturing engineer who is currently pursuing additional education in software development. I decided to change my path partly because I really enjoyed playing with data while I was a manufacturing engineer and partly because I am confused why data isn’t used more than it is in other contexts. I think part of the reason is because there’s still more opportunities to make user friendly software tools to make that happen, so hopefully I can help with that in the future. In any case, I’m currently enjoying learning a new skill at the moment, and this introduction will likely change as I progress over the next few months.",
